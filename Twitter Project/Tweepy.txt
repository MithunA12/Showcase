@erickmiles smh chile they want trump back badly and elon basically said he is backing out of the deal
@kazooshiz @Timcast You under the impression that the american left has only ever been compromised of marxists? While marxists have existed here for a long while this is a new development of radicalization within the left since social media. The left radicalized and pulling the right into moderates.
@pikachu_coin_io @leo @Ang https://t.co/fYMVNsF08n
I think Elon Musk drinks leftist tears, all of these people are freaking out about how he is "backing out" of his purchase because he is wanting sufficient evidence that there are bots on the Twitter platform as a whole. Also, a lot of people are upset about the bot experiment.
Elon Musk is starting to sound like Donald Trump part 2.

Elon Musk a detenido la compra de Twitter hasta que no tenga el número exacto de bots en la red, los propietarios, socios actuales afirman que solo es un 5% de los suscriptores actuales. Elon Musk afirma que es del 20%.  Hasta no tener un número exacto de los bots no hay compra https://t.co/dJehh7fmiQ

@enscand @ElectrekCo @FredericLambert JFC, this product isn't slowed down. Period. NOBODY has come closer to delivering on a fully autonomous automobile. Especially not the haters still clinging on to LIDAR years after Elon warned them that vision is all that was needed.
@EricSims3525 I feared Elon was going to do this, especially after what he did when he pumped and dumped Bitcoin. I think his goal was to expose Twitter. Well, he accomplished that goal, if nothing else.
@EricSims3525 Yes I'll vacate the premises asap just like I did Facebook.
@markadams500 @katstillhere Elon won’t pay for a social media platform whose CEO won’t disclose the number of bots that are on this app. The man doesn’t want to be overcharged for his purchase.  This tweet isn’t the flex that you think it is bud.

La noticia de que Elon Musk compró Twitter puso a grupos autodenominados “progresistas”, a políticos e incluso a periodistas fuera de sí, puesto que eso significaría qie Elon iba a dar una plataforma a las personas a las que esos grupos buscan silenciar.

@elonmusk @DineshDSouza @Teslarati I did Elon's suggested experiment and opened tabs of 15 random accounts following(holding page down and middle-clicking various areas of the page) Twitter's main account.  I was pretty shocked that only ended up with 1 that seemed a likely bot.   Anyone else try this?
@RotoPat @elon @Lawyers he already added like a million rightwing bots so he's prob safe -- or we are, depending on how you look at it
@DonkeyJulio @bennyjohnson @elonmusk what is exactly propaganda to you?  the truth?
@EricSims3525 This should be a poll.  And yes!
@Newsweek @elonmusk Why wouldn’t he , the Republican Party have gave him a huge tax cut so he keep more money in his pocket while it costs the rest of us.

@ESimplyJ oh
@MasonVersluis Yea man Elon is just like us so relatable forget he works for the Chinese and Qatari governments
@athie_gnome @TweetOfSteiner @tznkai @SendAliensToMe Maybe, but I'm starting from the assumption that Elon loves attention and he's willing to pay for it.  If you start from that, a lot of his behavior makes a lot more sense

@PhenomenalPoto You can waive due diligence to expedite a deal, and as part of a purchase agreement. But Musk would certainly have a claim if it turns out Twitter intentionally lied about its key user metric. The whole point of Musk bringing this up is to entice twitter to accept lower deal

Setting higher standards than those currently valid on Twitter can be quite acceptable to many, but it is also quite expected from someone like Elon Musk. However, there is no perfect platform or social network.   Constant improvment and development is a Must/Musk. https://t.co/4MKxD9LBYW

@GerberKawasaki Ross, your first sentence is accurate, but not quite right with the $14 billion. His damages are capped at a reverse termination fee of $1 billion. So TWTR has the option of suing him for $1 bn or compelling him to close (specific performance). Neither r great options for TWTR.
@EricSims3525 Yup! Made a twitter account because of him if the deal does fall apart I will be gone!

@realDailyWire You sods, this picture makes him look manic.
@RAFrenzy You make a great point. Its the back bone of it.  Sad reality.... I wasnt expecting all of that, came here to support Elon for a specific reason just as it all hit about Twitter and can't say this place can't be toxic.
@Amy_Siskind Ya he is not a very good business man
@MarketRebels I love how being a republican is ‘controversial’ 😅
Elon is on twitter literally every toilet break and tweets through every stoner-movie binge and yet he ONLY NOW REALISES just how full of bots this place is? What next, will he discover kpop fans crowd every hashtag as opposed to half of them? https://t.co/8wciyhJjrj

@Newsweek @MischievousLiz @elonmusk What state is he registered in?
@WholeMarsBlog @garyblack00 @squawksquare Elon understood that he can't combine Tesla with his other companies into X holding because Tesla shareholder base is different.  Tesla investors might not want btc and twtr side hussle or if Elon chooses it, more clear direction of his intent and assurance it won't impact Tsla.
@cb_doge @elonmusk If bots are 4 times (perhaps more) then that means the bots are 15% more than advertised by SEC filings.  I'd reduce the offer by 15/95 (about16%) and a 4% penalty.  So, 20% discount for lying to the SEC.
@mattyglesias @MarcGoldwein He stinks
@davidsmithplus @elonmusk @bennyjohnson Looks like Twitter confirmed it you POS.

@VanJaxn @ilovemyjobpj @H_MitchellPhoto @elonmusk $1B would be a modest price tag for Elon to escape what is now a major annoyance.   A few million isn’t going to induce Twitter to do anything, imho.
@EricSims3525 No I’m sure Twitter will take care of that for us
@memesaurs Seems probable. Perhaps he has realized what a leftist shitshow this place really is behind the scenes. If anything, he'll need to purge team Twitter on day one.

@TheRealHoarse @elonmusk Tesla was founded in July '03 by Martin Eberhard &amp; Marc Tarpenning. In February '04, via a $6.5 million investment, Elon Musk became the largest shareholder of the company. He's just a rich barnacle asshole regarding Tesla. SpaceX is his success and I suspect he just hired well.

@ericowensdc You can waive due diligence to expedite a deal, and as part of a purchase agreement. But Musk would certainly have a claim if it turns out Twitter intentionally lied about its key user metric. The whole point of Musk bringing this up is to entice twitter to accept lower deal

@longfellow_mr @Yanky_Pollak @RebelNewsOnline @elonmusk @bennyjohnson Idk, I think it would be hard to think that all this is some kind of surprise to Elon.  The guy thinks in terms of terraforming Mars, and those types of terms. I doubt that some dishonest twitter dynamics has got him floored.
@hodgetwins @genabalipatriot My grandpa said… “Republicans are always rich; if not in money than in life.”  I think that must be true.  They seem to be a much more rounded group and more successful.
@elonmusk @Teslarati You've stated that you will fight spam bots and Twitter is the de-facto town center. That means even without spam bots which you are fully aware of, you still think at the time Twitter is THE place for gathering, vote and interchange ideas. Please Elon, move on and fix Twitter.

I have no idea how many users - human or bot - Twitter has or what Elon Musk thinks/been advised.  Picking 100 random followers of a certain user is not the right sampling method. It's biased, it's called stratified sampling and it has limitations in generalization

These mega metropolises dotting the world compound many of the issues with waste, both physical and chemical, as we have to drive extreme projects to stabilize a stressed power grid and create "grey sky" hubs of unbreathable air.
@EricSims3525 It won’t fall apart but shareholders aren’t getting $54.20. The shares dropped ~20% since when he made the offer, based on know knowledge of the ins &amp; outs and it’s turning out Twitter was disingenuous about its product. No way Elon should not renegotiate.
I have opinions on this. Overpopulation is not inherently causing damage to the earth, but current factors that drive climate change are worsened by it. Furthermore, population density is a far more extreme issue than population count.  https://t.co/WOtC56FmDm

@joeshaney @TheInsiderPaper On the contrary, Elon is hit or miss when it comes to business and he has zero experience in social media. His latest tweets and comments advertise that he severely under qualified to run Twitter. He sounds like a confused teenager.

@garytexasjess . . . Texan Elon Musk comes out on top. Forbes magazine's new ranking of the world's richest people puts Musk at No. 1, with a net worth of $219 billion. That's up from $151 billion in 2021, $24.6 billion in 2020, $22.3 billion in 2019, and $19.9 billion in 2018.Apr 5, 2022

@elonmusk @Andst7 @paraga Hi Elon Musk from Finland. I have great respect for your achievements. Do you also see where Western democracies are going with our politicians? You have the power and the wealth to prevent this western collapse. I pray and ask that you do what you can.

@LeciaMichelle11 Of course “half” the bots is an exaggeration, but he has definitely created a ridiculous amount, which is why he knows bots account for more than 5% of Twitter accounts.
@AmandaLarreni Maybe. Definitely would not use it as much
@JaydonHartley @oaklandDude @elonmusk @bennyjohnson And its questionable whether Twitter's worth oh, I dunno, 25 bucks a share as apposed to 10 or 15.
@Truenortheh64 @ChuckCallesto If Twitter is overloaded with Bots…. Then Elon is certainly within his right to understand….   And if shares drop to reflect reality… he entitled to know that before the purchase

@elonmusk @Teslarati You are admired as a guy who work hard, think outside the box and get things done, not as the "dog ate my homework" kinda guy. Twitter will triple value once you're done with it, just purchases it as is. Whining about spam bots now doesn't help your reputation.
@QTRBlackGarrett @elonmusk @bennyjohnson I am kinda leaning towards Elon realizing twitter isn't a platform at all because 50%-90% of subscribers are bots or duplicate accounts Instead it is simply a money laundering operation to allow corporations to funnel money in the guise of advertisements, which is tax deductible
@Jules31415 Fed spending only causes inflation when it’s given largely to monopolists &amp; plutocrats who use it to complicate &amp; distort our economy &amp; for unproductive things like stock buy-backs-not if given to small biz (&amp; their customers) for local production &amp; distribution so supply =demand

@mattlindn @NameOnCooldown @visegrad24 Yup. They hate him because he refuses to bend the knee to whatever their sacred cow is: fossil fuels, legacy auto &amp; aerospace, vaccine mandates, unions, censorship, the dual extremism of climate denial &amp; climate alarmism. His refusal to grovel makes them absolutely unhinged.
@Dannyjokes Your pain brings us such joy.

He’s sensible. https://t.co/tCw3idiNv3
We all know and say that, but it takes someone with power and money @elonmusk to say it before they can hear it. Our Money doesn't speak loud enough with our government. https://t.co/aT2byPVDy4
@elonmusk sounds more &amp; more like a reasonable and sane moderate who listens to and appreciates many points of view. Sign of any good executive of any company &amp; his results so far prove it. He, as Reagan &amp; founders knew..America is the last stand on earth. https://t.co/zgY5yMwwA3 https://t.co/82H7j3RaOA
@DanielK11508833 @elonmusk @bennyjohnson if that's real he will either be fired by twitter most likely, or fired by elon for not wanting to work 12+ hour days
@kristy_clueless There is something of the night about Mr Musk. All will be revealed in time - no doubt
Holy SH— https://t.co/FTrIX1fbKw
@Katzy_Kins @FoodieBeautyOG Actually Elon musk says she can be here now! If you don't like it you are free to go! That's the great thing about free speech whether you like it or not everyone gets to have a say!
@Newsweek That means he has 1 follower Jill
@man_guz_ @elonmusk @johnrich How is that possible after they lose all their advertising because most of their users are bots. We should thank Elon for exposing the fraud.
@elonmusk @bennyjohnson No not really Elon. It’s someone that wants attention. You’re good. 👍🤣
This @Verge article is total jackassery. Billionaires that lean democracy are hard to find and perfection does not exist. If @JeffBezos we're as morally or ethically shaky as Musk he might've already said **** these people. @MikeBloomberg came round... https://t.co/GwsvM9wlhO
@D4RKH0LD777 who gave Elon a Chromatica Oreo?🤨
...to some realizations also and should be similarly credited. We are on a precipice. Encourage folks that have realized that. Ditch petty criticisms, use discernment and recruit for the team. Don't be a dickhead

@catturd2 @elonmusk Dear Elon, thanks for the boost to believe Twitter could allow free speech. No e of us expect it to last. Don’t buy Twitter. Too much baggage.
@JaydonHartley @oaklandDude @elonmusk @bennyjohnson It’s probably one of those gender-fluid abominations with neon coloured hair smashing a keyboard and seething about the takeover

@elonmusk @bennyjohnson Please Elon , breathe life into our humanity.
@Timcast .@elonmusk is an authoritarian loving oligarch with racist sympathies but unlike you .@Timcast he’s richer. But both of you are equally ignorant and selfish as one another filled with your particular kind of white elitist’s male entitlement.

@giftlovej $Nique2441
@elonmusk Hey Elon, There's someone at Twitter that's about to be crushed for getting caught talking. It would be a very cool thing, if you rescued him! In my opinion. I hope you see this.
@Thinklab1414 @ccowboy723 No he's not. Leftist politicians already created that war when they cultivated anger &amp; hatred among their followers, toward non-Leftists 2008-2012 &amp; increased it when Hillary lost @ 2016-today. Musk's goal is to keep Twitter open to Free Speech for everyone, not just one group.
Elon=the sword that sliced open Twitterbird's belly. https://t.co/xk9esl3grs
@NotWoofers No
@DisruptResearch Did you even watch the video? The video had the engineer calling fellow twitter staff commies not half the country.
@RNBWCV That’s where Elon found his bots.
@SweetPeachez69_ @tempf451 @ncweaver @Seanismacro @QtientQuotables @greyzone513 So your stance is: - Elon illegally acquired too many shares without filing - filed as a passive investor - announced he was joining the board - filed as an active investor - claimed he wanted to buy it to fix the bots - waived due diligence on the deal All to prove fraud?
Thread https://t.co/g1ILPjcpXZ
Simply put, Elon Musk has the key to change our future in the brightest way. Either you support him or you hate him it doesn’t matter. He will brighten our future.
Can Elon Musk really defeat the bots? https://t.co/ll5dMZwWyy
@realDailyWire This news gives me a semi 😆
@AndrewRCraig But if he complains enough about it he may be able to drive the price down of his incredibly expensive mistake or if he can produce any form of evidence to this just back out of the deal.

@Brainstorming03 @elonmusk That should not be a problem in a world beyond capitalism. Of course, if capitalism isn't left behind for something better, we will face lack of resources, ecocide, lack of jobs, etc. We need to organize around resources and human needs, not around profits and company properties.

I've said it before and I'll say it again. Elon Musk cannot afford Twitter. Tesla is over valued by as much as 200x. I'm not the only person to hold this view.  Mark my words- it won't happen. Not ever. The excuses will come, but ownership and control will not.
@tcburkejr It will eventually happen, and everyone will regret it the whole time?

@elonmusk Too many bots, I bet closer to 50%+. Don’t stop Elon we need someone to reverse this. It’s ruining society with these left wing nuts 🌰
@ccowboy723 Of course. Only fools keep them in power.
@matt_levine If he loses a “specific performance” clause, couldn’t it be enforced by seizing his assets and liquidating enough of them to pay for the deal?
@realDailyWire If this thing gets ratified it won't matter! In five days, Gates flies to Davos to finalize the WEF/UN/WHO takeover of our Sovereign Nation. Then the unelected WHO will decide ???

Elon Musk frenó la compra de Twitter hasta que le muestren la cantidad real de cuentas falsas https://t.co/8q8UI4QPid
I’m sure Elon already knew that IT companies let it slide for the most part, to inflate the numbers that help “sell” the business.  The leverage is in what the “sell” is.  Influence, for the individuals and a two layered business for the platform.  That was the biggest mistake.
@elonmusk hi Elon, I want to get my account verified. I have news links and many published books available on amazon all over US,UK and INDIA. Still they everytime reject it. Please help. Please.please help me in my growth. You have faced 2008 period. You know how important it is

@NotWoofers I don't think so.  The market is telling us that it doesn't think so.  Musk did no due diligence so can't come back at TWTR on subs.  Caveat emptor.  TWTR will sue Musk for breach of agreement and try to force him to pay the now ridiculous $54.20 but will walk away with a deal.

I’m not following this Johnny Depp/Amber Heard (and now James Franco) thing.  And now Elon Musk is involved, too?  Imagine this guy’s reaction if he’d heard that… https://t.co/EiE74JMEKy
On this path, if Elon doesn’t buy Twitter they’ll probably ban him from the app. https://t.co/VaTlXC8Kgx

@Albert301271 Całkowicie zrozumiałe. Jeśli kupowałbym np. stacje telewizyjną to płaciłbym proporcjonalnie do ilości widzów. Jeśli duża część Twittera to boty, to oznaczałoby że twitter jest przeceniony.
@PmurtTrump I knew it was a fake, he knew if the stocks tanked, like Tesla has been off and on.  He has lost billions since last year ...

@davidsmithplus @elonmusk @bennyjohnson Wow Dave you’re a pretty dim bulb. Everyone paying attention knows not just Twitter, but all of Silicon Valley is full of leftist communist who hate the United States and what the USA stands for.
@esaagar Then talk about corporations gouging Americans on breaking points instead of your inane infatuation about Elon musk, and UFOs
@PhineasRolberg @MollyJongFast Thanks for the answer.  It helps to know that someone else also thinks that Musk’s rationale is insensible.
@ccowboy723 There is no shortage of fools in the US.
@Newsweek @elonmusk Pretty sure.. no one cares?
@EricSims3525 I’ll close my account Again
@WholeMarsBlog @garyblack00 @squawksquare Partially true. Tesla would have drawn more (retail) investors if it wasn’t for @elonmusk juvenile behavior and politically charged sentiments on twitter. I’m a Tesla bull and I find Elon’s behavior distasteful. Many of my friends feel the same.
Why are less people talking about Elon buying twitter bc of bots that are tracking him?!? Another rich white guy controlling our platforms....
@MailOnline lol this is easily disproven by...everyone's observations. But keep pushing the totally reliable source of..."recording". Especially one from PV lol.

For Twitter to go private it is imperative that all accounts must be properly authenticated  otherwise trust might just as well fly out by the window. We want to talk to the real deal and not fakes. There are just too many 'Elon Musk's' out there causing enormous damage

@atticusflynch Atticus do you think Elon has seen my tweets plugging Barry’s birthday show yet? I should have specifically invited him in the tweet😢.  Hindsight is 20 20. Anyway we should start planning as if he’s coming, that way no big deal if he doesn’t show. Failure to plan is planning for

@Jaxtheresister It's very fair for the wealthy. So I'm not sure what he's blabbering about. Unless it's to mock and insult those that aren't wealthy that talk about how difficult life can be. It's hard to see those struggles from his ivory tower.

@bennyjohnson It's actually a very ignorant statement that Elon made. If you know anything about a teleprompter...a speech has to be written by a speech writer, approved by the president, and then uploaded to a teleprompter to be read. A teleprompter is NOT a machine that writes speeches.
@matt_levine he doesn't want twitter he just doesn't like bots. and shoved a deal at twitter higher ups to force them to look at the problem. He's full of shit.

@InsideEVs Elon Musk is a beta male cuck that is afraid to talk about the mass murder that happened within 5 miles of Gigafactory 2 in Buffalo, NY. He doesn't want to talk about how he would moderate the murders videos and if he'd allow them on Twitter.

Experts say, just because @elonmusk passed on due diligence on the TWTR purchase, he still has legal cause to walk away if they misrepresented the number of users they have. Also, it would be very costly to fight this in court for TWTR. Elon may just be getting a discount!! LOL

@NovElection2024 Same with me! As a gay man I was taught that Republicans hated me. Since 2016 I've slowly woken up! I'm voting red down the ballot. Democrats have hurt my bank account, and gone absolutely batshit crazy "woke" and everyone's a victim of white ppl. Sick of it!
@edwardnh Musk is a living example of the SEC's fecklessness. He's a clown but also he's doing harm to investors with his antics.
@PearceAlan1962 SPOT ON!!! https://t.co/RbOu55aNpg
@elonmusk @bennyjohnson ok Elon how much did you pay for this video to get made and posted on a verified account
Yep! https://t.co/94gwCZqtMO

Shocking https://t.co/ZojFjtQ35C
@nypost @BretBaier Even though the deal is in limbo now?  Clearly there are games being played here.
Serious hive mind question - what has Elon Musk actually, directly, personally done that's been interesting or innovative, other than throwing (largely preexisting) money at a lot of technical innovators who seem to remain anonymous?
@dittmander @andersonDrLJA Therrrrrre's a shocker.  And who is the real one?
@jrmikey80 @elonmusk @bennyjohnson I'm not sure what Newsmax, OANN &amp; Fox have to do with it, it's common knowledge Twitter leans left my guy.

@FoxNews Top class JERK !!  (I always considered him one even before his Twitter purchase affair)
@PolitiReality You open to betting?
@HelenKennedy Yeah, the bots.  Nothing to do with Tesla stock being over-leveraged by his previous financial shenigans and/or cannot raise the cash so that he is trying to get the price of the purchase down.  This is called security fraud.
@DonkeyJulio @bennyjohnson @elonmusk You are one of the bots he will be deleting soon. Standby for deletion.

@elonmusk Hi Elon, 🙋🏻‍♀️ We do not know one other. But, the folks who do know you are apparently ineffectual at imparting to you the vast array of negative consequences attendant to your chatting on Twitter. You simply should not do this. It is (likely illegal) self-injury.  C ⚖️

Elon Musk: I want to buy it to fix it.  A16z, Binance, Larry Page etc: We'll support you with millions!  Also Elon Musk: It's Broken that's why I don't want to buy it just yet.
@MikeIsaac In a shitty position because they’ve made shitty moves
@Newsweek @elonmusk Who freaking cares? He's a rich, entitled white supremacist who doesn't give a shit about anything but his money.
@FantasyDocDude It's actually a very ignorant statement that Elon made. If you know anything about a teleprompter...a speech has to be written by a speech writer, approved by the president, and then uploaded to a teleprompter to be read. A teleprompter is NOT a machine that writes speeches.
@ElectrekCo @SCOOTERDOLL Elon Musk is a beta male cuck that is afraid to talk about the mass murder that happened within 5 miles of Gigafactory 2 in Buffalo, NY. He doesn't want to talk about how he would moderate the murders videos and if he'd allow them on Twitter.
@dalienx @Yanky_Pollak @elonmusk @bennyjohnson And Twitter will also go down in a flaming heap of dung if that happens. 😂
@Albert1049 @POTUS This is one I disagree with under our current of circumstances. I think, however, Elon is saying this in the future he envisions, where we use use resources MUCH more efficiently and have sustainable energy.
@ManMadeMoon Mate…
@shitcoinisseur That's their fault for buying a stock above the pending buy out price at a P/E ratio of 180. It was a greedy thing to do on their part.  Elon shouldn't be locked into a deal made on fraudulent terms for the sake of other people.

@elonmusk Elon musk claims he wants to purchase Twitter to protect freedom of speech interests.  Do you believe that?
@AmandaLarreni Yes, I have no intention staying on a platform that handles things the way twitter did before musk was going to buy it.
@PolitiReality I think looking into @ethereumJoseph and @ethereum and @novogratz is a much better way to use resources. They actually harmed people.

@ccowboy723 Elon treats the entire planetary population as though we were dupes and fools. He is a fraud and a grifter, deserving of criminal felony prosecution for securities fraud.
@realChasDarwin @elonmusk Still deflecting. The point, mr. Intellectually dishonest is that, in speaking to your original comment” is that blocking someone for whatever reason doesn’t infringe on the other persons right to say what they want. The two are not mutually exclusive
Can't help but wonder whether Elon has created bots to get out of the deal. I've never seen so many bots on here.
I love that Elon Musk is so savvy that he can get the SEC to maybe do what they and the media should have done years ago and investigate to massive amounts of bots and shills employed by Liberals on Twitter.

@WR4NYGov What critics may not realize is  @elonmusk has a master plan and is slowly revealing it to the public as parts and pieces of the plan come together, overtime. Sure, there are variables he’s face / currently facing / will face, but he’s got his shit together, clearly.
@squawksquare He's his own marketing team. Every day, good or bad, he makes and holds the news.  Bullish.

@2HELLWITHMITCH2 You don’t think calling Twitter a socialist workplace is laughable? That Elon Musk cares about free speech? There’s no pretension here this is basic stuff.
@TimRunsHisMouth And the most humorous thing about all of it, is that if Elon does walk, the advertisers who have been overpaying Twitter for the past several years for real accounts are going to sue…

@ElectrekCo @FredericLambert Elon Musk is a beta male cuck that is afraid to talk about the mass murder that happened within 5 miles of Gigafactory 2 in Buffalo, NY. He doesn't want to talk about how he would moderate the murders videos and if he'd allow them on Twitter.
@WR4NYGov I’ve been buying 🤷🏻‍♂️
@WR4NYGov Having run automotive manufacturing, I can say with 💯 certainty that leadership focus matters.  Tesla has an exceptional team, but human nature is to look to the leader to set the pace and focus.  What many employees see is distraction.

@bennyjohnson @elonmusk Is he confusing left and communism or is he really that dumb? Of course he is worried about his “job”. He works four hours a week. No oversight. Changes if Elon comes in. Actually got to earn your money.
@iamraisini @elonmusk @EvaFoxU @SECGov From 9% he can go up to 15% so, dropping down the share price is basically is in his favor! Otherwise, why would he discuss this subject publicly? Think also about the others who would buy now and are part of the new private company!

@elonmusk @EvaFoxU @SECGov @elonmusk you already know no one is home at the SEC.  You built an entire empire by sucking up investment capital making outlandish claims. Your Tesla build rate estimates have been off by literally an order of magnitude at times.  Twitter is just running the Elon Musk playbook.
@FoxNews Go get 'em Elon!!!! It's time to clean house!!!!!
Basically, he clicked "I've read terms &amp; conditions" without having read the terms and conditions like every single other person on Twitter. https://t.co/p8DR3rHIng

@therecount He’s a broke boy, pump faking and fake Flexin because he doesn’t have the money to buy the platform
@elonmusk @bennyjohnson And Elon, you are a smart guy. I'm sure you know of forensic tools that can confirm authenticity. Ok, gotcha, rhetorical question.
Kicking out every moderate person person as a "Far Right Extremist" in itself seems like a trolling ploy it's like an experiment of "How far can we Troll until they reject us" I can't tell who's the victim or perpetrator anymore just All of USA https://t.co/cxVB6BQl6J

@squawksquare just wait 6 hours and this dude will find a reason to flip insanely bullish again. Maybe cause Elon has a nice and natural bowel movement or something.
@Esqueer_ At least you don't get a single character emoji.  Bearing in mind where the share price goes without Elons bid it's likely a compromise needs to be achieved. I think Elon has a case that real users vs fake users is higher than declared in SEC docs and possibly and board agree.
@realDailyWire It seems to me that the Elon Musk cartoon showing the Left accelerating left-ward is more accurate.  The Right isn’t moving right, it just looks that way as the left warps to the far, far left. https://t.co/cqjlvdrvHj

@ginnyhogan_ In this case he is done but Twitter is left unsatisfied.
@ccowboy723 The real fools are anyone who gives AF about anything Elon musk has to say, especially if you believe the reason he’s bailing on the twitter deal has anything to do with bots.
Why does this only apply to #Twitter and not other social media? Why does this man claim to be about freedom of speech but have factories in China? It’s all a scam. He just wants his own manipulation device. https://t.co/dkkSPZODPr
Another flaw in his argument is that advertisers are focused on brand awareness via Twitter and there is a small ratio of likes per total users.  Well if advertisers want to create awareness, the better metric would be impressions rather than likes.
WHAT??? https://t.co/2WxpY41fb7

@theMRC @elonmusk Fed spending only causes inflation when it’s given largely to monopolists &amp; plutocrats who use it to complicate &amp; distort our economy &amp; for unproductive things like stock buy-backs-not if given to small biz (&amp; their customers) for local production &amp; distribution so supply =demand
@EricSims3525 Yes
@EricSims3525 I left Twitter and Facebook both over 2 years ago due to the censorship. I recently returned after the news of Elon making the deal and killing off the censorship. However I wouldn't have be a problem leaving again if the deal went sour. Free speech or no speech thanks!
@edcu @racecar_babytoy @johnfguild @mattyglesias What if Twitter lied?  That matters not?  You’re hanging way to much on this deal. The deal didn’t create inflation and supply chain disruption.

@therecount It's actually a very ignorant statement that Elon made. If you know anything about a teleprompter...a speech has to be written by a speech writer, approved by the president, and then uploaded to a teleprompter to be read. A teleprompter is NOT a machine that writes speeches.
@stevenmarkryan I wonder if Elon can keep the 1b$ if the bot claim is true(greater than 5%). As this would be considered false reporting by twitter I order to elevate their own worth…
@DonkeyJulio @bennyjohnson @elonmusk Ahh so I see you are at the "this isn't happening" stage.   Eventually you will move on to "Okay, but it's rare"   Then you'll get to what you really believe, "it's happening and it's good that it's happening"

Elon Musk said his $44 billion deal for Twitter can’t move forward until the company is clearer about how many of its accounts are fake https://t.co/PUbhwbME2o
@stephen_taylor It's quite possible that the market performance of Elon's cash cow, TSLA, is influencing his opinion on TWTR.  Tesla stock is still a very pricey stock but it is down 40% from its high and that is many billions to Elon.
@elon_set When you put it like that, you sound even more as if you're feeling oppressed.  You have put yourself on your own list.
@blangb Yes, Elon has endeared himself to the SEC, and they are jumping when he says jump.
@GeorgeTakei There ARE a lot of fake accounts. I'm blocking lots of fake followers all the time...🤔 https://t.co/TguxrE6PV2

@MaxAbrahms Musk is synonymous with crypto and that part of twitter has a massive bot prolem going on for years now largely unnoticed by the rest on this app you probaly caught some of that tweeting on Musk.

@Reuters Excuses and excuses! 😃
Elon Musk halted the #Twitter acquisition awaiting confirmation that bots are less than 5% of users.  A recent Twitter analysis report found that over 19.42% of all Twitter users are fake or spambots.   @elonmusk $TWTR #TwitterTakeover https://t.co/HWM05lq7SG
@MailOnline That's a lie and it's not what they said.
@edoswald @elonmusk @Teslarati It is Elon’s strategy =&gt; lose-lose situation for Twitter.. playing around with financial regulations..
@realDailyWire @guypbenson Me too.

@Albert1049 @POTUS Considering many of our processes have less than 20% efficiency, ICE vehicles for example, IF we changed that and started getting decent numbers, like 70 or 80%, we absolutely could double the population. But, we would have to DRAMTICALLY increase efficiency across the board.
@Squirrel3218 @Reuters No. He is happy to move forward if they can prove the spam bots are less then 5%   Why would he let himself get ripped off?

@PatriotKristen @MDay4USA And swift too.  Elon is no dummy.  He found out that the sample they took was from just 100 people.  Out of millions of users. I predict he will get that company for billions less.  Or he will walk away.✌
«Elon Musk said Joe Biden is treating the American public like fools.»    By Elon Musk’s own admission that he always voted Democrat till now, he must have voted for Biden during the last election!   So who is the bigger fool: Biden, or Musk ... who actually VOTED for Biden?

Free speech is not about the truth of the content (which, is obviously a subjective assessment in a lot of cases). Free speech allows pushback. Wondering why you are latching on to alleged untruths?

@PreetaTweets How sincere was his desire to buy Twitter in the first place? (Not a rhetorical question.)
@SraMYaguchi @garyblack00 @WholeMarsBlog @squawksquare It’s not supposed to just follow Qs. If there are no changes in fundamentals, it should follow Qs X Teslas’s Beta. But it reported blow out earnings and was up a lot, for that reason. This decline is not macro driven. It is self inflicted and perfectly correlated to TWTR noise.

@blatherat @Amy_Siskind I don't remember anyone twisting his arm and begging him to buy Twitter. It's a hostile takeover. Nobody told him what price he had to offer. Now he's finding out about bots and worrying that algorithms produce confirmation bias. Might be regretting an impulse buy.

@stillgray I think that less than 20% of comments are bots. But if you look at any account's followers, I think you'll find that a lot are. I'd guess higher than 20%.   Even for people with no followers (like me), I'm pretty sure several are spam accounts trying to get me to follow back.

@PmurtTrump You know how trump would tease the public regarding anything controversial he said he'd do, musk is rather like trump in that respect. He also dances around, teases by throwing his hat off then like a stripper takes his jacket off throwing it to the side. His young fans go wild.
@postalbuck23 That's why they're going 🐵💩 over Elon Musk taking over he's not going to put up with that nonsense.
@AmandaLarreni Musk actually calls the American people who elected Biden fool
@ccowboy723 Perhaps Biden does not know that he is treating America like fools, perhaps he does not know any better.  Perhaps expecting him to treat America with respect and to protect it, is expecting too much from him.

@Esqueer_ The "deal" he offered had no performance requirements on Twitter related to anything in particular. He is trying to single handedly reset the terms of the deal. That isn't how contracts work.  Hope $TWTR holders get their $54.20 and Musk loses $TSLA paying up.
Abartısız söylüyorum, Twitter'daki hesapların EN AZ %30'u bot. Geri kalanların da yarısı fake ve türevi hesaplar. Elon abem o hesapları silip süpürürse 2013-14 dönemi Prime Twitter'ına dönüş yapabiliriz. https://t.co/t5jXSj56IT

@AmandaLarreni Good question.   If he doesn't buy twitter it's because they were not honest in their SEC report.   Claiming less than 5% bots versus over 20% bots is huge.  He'd have to lower his purchase bid.   Nobody wants to buy air, although democrats sell it... cheap!
@reckless Calling him a "free speech advocate" gives him too much credit IMO. More like "Whatever speech I like" advocate.
@AmandaLarreni Guns, God, Greed and the GOP... All you need to know to realise that the American public ARE fools. Only cretins vote Republican.
@realMeetKevin @elonmusk What a fucking moron 😂
@GerberKawasaki For a man who uses Twitter a lot, he definitely knew there were more than 5% bots….anyone who spends a few minutes can see this..This has to be a negotiating tactic. Now it gets very interesting. *sippin my tea

@davidsmithplus @elonmusk @bennyjohnson Project Veritas is legit.
@RebelNewsOnline It's actually a very ignorant statement that Elon made. If you know anything about a teleprompter...a speech has to be written by a speech writer, approved by the president, and then uploaded to a teleprompter to be read. A teleprompter is NOT a machine that writes speeches.
@MailOnline I guess you also disapprove of Twitch censoring the Buffalo shooter?  No?  (But you do want to see it don't you?)  Do I detect a bit of cognitive dissonance?  Do you see where I'm going with this?  (the 1st Amendment doesn't protect dangerous speech, it's been decided)
@Newsweek @elonmusk Not sure why everyone wouldn’t at all levels. Every democrat ran state is drowning in taxes, every democrat ran city is a murderous free for all with homeless on every corner. Look what our president is doing to our economy with no plan other than to blame Russia. They suck!
Elon out here grasping at straws trying to get out of buying Twitter or paying the $1B fee https://t.co/JoQ36hps4Y

@kate_sills I'd like to read your view on this. I didn't imagine him throwing his hat in that ring, so I couldn't say about him pulling out.  And besides, I don't know whether he's pulling out or bargaining.

@elonmusk @elonmusk Hi Elon, I’m Canadian. Over the past 3 to 4 months I have noticed tons of comments I used to see from Twitter users from other countries, have dropped dramatically. Has Twitter somehow done something to make that happen? They don’t want us communicating, comparing. 🧐
@Sebfcb14 Immer dieser Elon Musk, nur am Hacken
@VineMan5 @AP I was thinking the same.
@Hqdepot1 @newsmax @elonmusk Elon Musk paid taxes according to how the system is structured. He doesn't make tax laws in the country. Your members of Congress are in charge of legislation to make sure everyone pays taxes accordingly.
@mominbayarea Hey Mom. Isn't it awesome how the woman are running this court room? JD/AH
TBH, it could be both. Maybe his strategy was, buy Twitter, but create turmoil during the process, at which time he cashes out short positions, which help his finances for after the purchase completes.  THIS is what the SEC should be looking at, though.
@Timcast I don't think this is representative of anything. Musk is extremely wealthy. Most of that wealth is tied up in stocks and unrealized gains. Liberals have discussed taxing unrealized gains on the super-wealthy. That would hurt Musk.

@EarthGlows Your argument actually makes 0 sense. They both talked abt divorce &amp; she claimed she thought he already filed… she dumped Elon bc she apparently wasn’t in love with him… she asked for 3 penthouses, the Range Rover&amp; $ tax free. She has the pledged $ for 13 months before he sued
@johnrich @elonmusk Elon sticking his dick in a toaster was actually a great move, lol

@FoxNews No doubt at all.
@moodyangela @LaTR75 @everywhereist I agree that older men who only find women in their teens/20s attractive are creeps. I also think there's a big difference between only being attracted to young women and not being attracted to women in their 70s. But that's just my perspective as a 40-something.
I imagine the people at Google are also very nervous about Elon getting Twitter.  They do the same manipulations with Youtube and search.  Elon can expose everything. https://t.co/LRXpZ5RE8u
It’s almost like if people took bullying seriously we wouldn’t be in this mess of a society we’d have the tools to deal with people like Elon. https://t.co/6B7ICjmtUA

@WashTimes He is 100% correct! https://t.co/H5Vo5mMbPQ
@crosado1968 Another personality cult.
@cromcrofty I've seen that top tweet like 30 times today from the bots. Ironically as Elon is calling out the bot net.
@garytexasjess It was nice to learn all the good thing’s Mr. Musk is doing. I think he has enough $$ to provide Ukraine with the military resources to kick Putin‘s ass. Wish you do that. Wonder woman can only do so much. https://t.co/DyjDfpfmS8
A year ago today I met  @elonmusk at the #GigaFactoryBerlin. Thank you for always willing to listen the ideas and problems of your customers. Tesla is still the best car I've driven.  Still a fascinating time to witness this transition. Keep your chin up Elon! https://t.co/Khy8G9Gr9A
@943thePoint Too bad she raised a SADISTIC PSYCHOPATH for a son!!! That will be proven next year (Neuralink trial)! Maybe runs in the family??? This is what Musk does to monkeys folks! Pass it on! https://t.co/zOFDYyiBtR
@squawksquare Maybe he should stop acting altogether &amp; focus on being the CEO of a $70B company. Maybe someday Tesla (the company, not the stock) will actually be a $700B company rather than just a stock. Careful observers will see the obvious stumbling block with him doing any such thing.
@WUTangKids Poor Elon, pinning his hopes on Project Veritas and not understanding the rule: if that claim truth in their name, it's not.
@bennyjohnson @elonmusk Anyone with a functioning brain and who is not already "Red" has already realized that @Twitter is as "Commie as F**k".  So good for Veritas - another confirmation. But why the outrage when Elon makes the buy from MSM and the Biden Regime? Maybe they're also as Commie as F**k.
@rockstar_stocks Does @elonmusk dream of electric sheep?

@SFreiburg @Carnage4Life More importantly, Elon knew there was a bot problem when he put in the offer. Solving the bot problem was supposed to be one of the reasons why he's purchasing the company.  And now he's like, "I can't buy Twitter, it's full of bots"  More like, "I can't buy Twitter, stonks down"

@bennyjohnson This is what waking up looks like.  👏
@RubinReport @elonmusk This just seems to me like a "lessor of two evils" argument. Elon should use his influence to back a real third party. I think America is finally ready to give an outsider a real shot.

@EricSims3525 Yes, because I have other options
@cb_doge @elonmusk No it was the caffeine in the hot cocoa. Omg Elon.
@Not_the_Bee I'd rather Elon keep his billions he pays in taxes and reinvest than the government taking those billions and pissing them away or shipping them to Ukraine.

@bennyjohnson @elonmusk That's why Elon Musk is taking a deep dive in to the company. The employee base is Woke, radical and a forum to raise the racial card to the extreme. Elon Musk knows what he's doing, and to question that fact by his employees they are now unemployed

@AmandaLarreni Twitter is like a whoopie cushion. It's fun for about 5 minutes and then it gets old. As long as advertisers are involved it'll never be something anyone can trust.
@DonkeyJulio @bennyjohnson @elonmusk What about this is propaganda?
@DemocraticDaisy @GOPChairwoman I am middle class and I enjoyed the tax cuts and my 401K. The month of April through mid may I’ve lost 92.000 in my 401K. The rich pay taxes, 2021 Elon paid over 11 billion in taxes. That does not include his employees, healthcare, state and local taxes.
A docu series made by vision films About elon musk calling him the real live iron man...no thats not a bit marvel😆
@TPostMillennial The real story is that there are millions of people out there who feel the same way but were bullied into silence.   At some point the Dems (who I always voted for) cut off their right arm. What the party is doing to this country is shocking.

@EricSims3525 No.  He based his purchase price on SEC filings which he is asking them to prove.  If they can’t prove them Elon walks away, and Twitter may have problems with the SEC.  Elon has lawyers and accountants all over this.

@elonmusk It's financial ploy to benefit Twitter's current ownership in revenue probably a lot more fake than even Elon says
If Twitter is really a town square for ideas like Elon musk says then it should be owned by the government not a businessman
Elon Musk is the real mccoy, imagine making a $44 billion acquisition of a social network. And somehow you change your mind about the acquisition and you have to pay $1 billion termination fee.
@TheElk801 @unclekartwheel @Twitter @elonmusk So what if he's born rich? He's doing more good for the world than Paris Hilton, Kim Kardashian or Hunter Biden.
@realabzhu @long_jimi Just like he reversed course and decided not to join Twitter's BOD. This sounds like one big distraction for what's coming down the road.

@umarsaif Are you a Bot or Real?
@silklark Awww poor Elon 🥺😥❤️‍🩹
@MaxAbrahms No. US gov gave 10.7 million to Twitter for user accounts. Propaganda to keep him from buying and make him feel he would lose stock and favor by buying. Also, whenever America has an election dormant bots get activated. It's midterms. During a Presidential election it's worse.
@EricSims3525 No
Hey, Elon.  Is it just me or do this fucks like wasting time?
@dka67 @nypost Ok, then why do you lefties have such a hard time admitting that Twitter is censoring with a leftist bias? And why do you complain when Elon Musk buys Twitter?

@Hqdepot1 @newsmax @elonmusk Elon Musk earned his billions. Nobody handed them to him for free.

@MailOnline Can we please stop with the Project Veritas nonsense?  They have never had credibility and hit bottom with their “expose” of the Pennsylvania Postal worker claiming he heard co workers talking about changing ballots.
@BenjaminASaenz All I feel when I hear what he bought is disappointment and anger. I get it, he has money and he spends it. But to me it seems he spends it like a little childe in the toy store instead of using it wisely. Money changes people, and not for the good.
@DanielK11508833 @elonmusk @bennyjohnson I think it would be cool if Elon hired Trump to be Personnel manager at twitter. Oh my God their heads would explode
@AromaLady2 I returned because of Elon and I enjoy it here, so I'm not positive yet what I'll do if it falls through.
@nypost I'm Joe Biden?
@WholeMarsBlog @elonmusk I get that you’re loyal to Elon. But Mars doesn’t cost him 44B in a 1 transaction &amp; resorting to margin. Shareholders are owners of tesla too. Fact is Elon is acting like a child &amp; hurting the very people who made him richest man on earth. You’re too biased &amp; bordering illogical
@Newsweek @elonmusk I’m right there with him! I’ve always voted as a democrat but the party has gone NUTS …… I will be voting Republican for the first time in my life! They can thank the “woke” agenda for it!

@Yolo304741 Because the president is a puppet and whoever runs the teleprompter is the puppet master
@Newsweek @elonmusk Yesssss!!! Bring America BACK!! I am a legal immigrant, worked hard for every red cent I’ve ever made!! God Bless America!!
It is obvioys that the right more than the left is censored on @Twitter, cuz the right is more inclined to advocate for &amp; commit illegal &amp; violent acts: insurrection, sedition, mass murder. Stuff like that. Seen the Dems doing that? Ask #ElonMusk! https://t.co/DU608DPR31

@DebbiesStories I have eaten a considerable amount of Spam in my life… 20%? Dunno. Seems like a lot. I might allow that I am 1.8% Spam, though.
@JasonNafziger @GlanvilleCaleb @ChuckleLaughing It’s a mute point anyway. They are covered under the The National Firearms Act.
@NovElection2024 Democrats have shown that they can’t stop spending, can’t control crime or inflation.  Obviously Republicans should take over for the good of our country.
@WUTangKids Why is he acting like he’s buying this bird app sight unseen??? Like he had no idea of the culture of Twitter??                                                                    Emusty right now: https://t.co/nLxBFunjxc

@KobeissiLetter @elonmusk The question is whether Twitter is worth Elon's 40+ Billion USD. The platform is only worth as much money as the volume of organic engagement it enjoys.
They won’t https://t.co/tpE1ecPstz
@elonmusk The Elon Plan!  👉 So you use bots.  👉 So you know they exist.  👉 Waived your due diligence.  👉 Have broken the contract by disparaging Twitter.  👉 And you think you can get out of the billion walkaway deal by claiming "BOTS!!!"?   🤣 LOL now that is funny.

@Sgt_Hot_Stuff @abarber1 Ok.  Lets agree, spam-bots are a cover to back out of the deal because the economic landscape of growth companies has changed.   Unethical is a stretch and illegal/breach is for the lawyers to decide.  Its cutthroat business in that sphere.  Big deal
@pakalamazoo @Jaxtheresister So because a large portion of the electorate in this country lacks critical thinking skills I should give a damn about Elon's musings on life? Not sure what connection you're trying to make here.

@ideafaktory @matt_levine Elon belongs in prison
@sashayanshin Ultimately, Elon will own Twitter. The deal will be re-priced and life moves on. The court in Delaware will force this deal to happen.   Twitter will be upgraded as will Tesla, SpaceX, etc. There may be short term pain but Twitter will be worth much more under Elon's direction.
@browneyegirl400 lol. Cutting the cord instantly drops the IQ to it's normal lower state. We can do better than built back butt butter.

@EricSims3525 Yup
@RyanChandler85 @Rudibager @elonmusk @johnrich as part of his offer he wanted some information on how Twitter presents itself to its advertisers.
@EricSims3525 Well now that it's revealed to be half bogus crap we can just stay here and enjoy ourselves the same.   We've always known TWIT only censors conservatives.   So unless  people tell me another social media is as fun as it is here?   I'll stay.

@Karate_Kaninen @texasbreakfast1 @raeisgonnadoit @TheEmilyDBaker I hope that's not the kind of free speech Elon Musk supports, especially if he's her baby's biological father.
@LeaderGrev I (like many) was so confused when Twitter accepted the merger — with enthusiasm no less! Really changed the optics of Twitter as a company for me. Elon is essentially a financial poltergeist, and surely you don’t make a deal with a poltergeist unless you’re desperate.

@TeslaAndDoge Texas also siphoned off a chunk of their power grid to Crypto Miners.  Another example of Musk not understanding 'due diligence'.
I had a lot of fun listening to Elon on Chamath's podcast yesterday. He is literally Trump 2.0. Meaning, he has great ideas, and is caring about free speech and seemingly the human race as a whole, yet the system is going to slander him like no other if he keeps it up.

@AmandaLarreni Nah I’ll keep speaking my mind to leftist weirdos until I get kicked off.
@LarryEKlayman Trump's big 2016 campaign promise - "Drain the Swamp", still chanted at 2022 rallies. However, once elected Trump chose 65 members of the deep state swamp, CFR members &amp; Bilderberg attendees for all key roles in his administration and 3 SC Justices, all combined to backstab MAGA.

@Newsweek @elonmusk 🖕🏻
and to those that think Elon will shift the weight of the scales in favor of the Dems, he won't. Mainly because he doesn't need to Conservatives hold everyone accountable and have plenty of substance to earn votes without the brainwashing and nefarious tricks the left uses https://t.co/Ie5Sh7S4qw

@TPostMillennial There's no evidence this person works at Twitter, and certainly not as a "top engineer." A "senior engineer" position is likely very low in the overall org structure  So it's a fake person, with a likely lowish-level job. Par for the course for Veritas
@travisctravels @muskyblacksheep @SRuhle @chicagobars Musk's 13D for TWTR has 3 amendments since 4/21, none retract amendment 3's disclaimer of due diligence.  The debt Musk is using is a margin loan against his TSLA shares. MS doesn't care less what Elon spends the money on because if he defaults they get the collateral.

@Timcast Are people not allowed to have changing political opinions without it being the fault of someone? Maybe Elon just finds his values align more with the right now 😂 You guys are so terminally online and hyperpartisan, it's crazy.
@Newsweek @elonmusk According to birdbrain leftists, he's now officially a Walmart Shopper.

Share so I say fuck the deal even tho I'm a Republican and it hurts free speech. It just goes to show Twitter is a bad company and Elon found out the truth. I would still buy but at a lower price. If I'm a share holder I'm pissed right now at the company for lying

@realDailyWire @LivePDDave1 Only good ones, I hope.  Not RINOs.
@EricSims3525 Yes
@atrupar @elonmusk Sure you WOULD SAY THAT!! You don't want Elon to OWN TWITTER!
@seanhannity As are yours and Elon Musk's. We could go on for hours and the conclusion is the same.
@hodgetwins I think he draws too much attention and they’ll try to bring him down . He’s way too popular to be allowed to be against them in the public .

@Hqdepot1 @newsmax @elonmusk In a better country, anybody can become an "Elon Musk" and succeed. You don't whine about other people's success for being more smarter and hard worker than you.
@johnedgell No. Wow, you are either a shill or a tool.  The question was whether Elizabeth Warren or Elon Musk made more jobs. My point was, and still is, Warren has *actively* destroyed jobs.  Get with the program or stay away from conversations, you hack.

@DonkeyJulio @bennyjohnson @elonmusk Literal video evidence and you're still this obtuse.
transparency on Twitter as a “declaration of war”against the Regime. As the Integrity Initiative’s use of the platform shows, Twitter’s value to U.S.-aligned intelligence agencies as a friendly ground for influence operations far exceeds its nominal value as a technology company.
Since the $44 billion is on hold  Elon Musk can now decide to buy Ghana instead of Twitter
@DebbiesStories If it stops his deal call me anything you want. I can start by calling people comrades.
@JByate @TheLuxGuy666 @FlankyTrades @YourAnonNews How does the left have obtuse philosophies? they’re advocating for rights. how is that obtuse? and elon wants to bring back trump, who abuses his power and free speech, invoked a capital riot, and Elon wants to bring on more right leaning members, while dismissing the left.
@CNNBrasil Pensei em Cássia Kiss vendo essa capa...
@RobPMKE @Garrett_Love @elonmusk Actually no he's making a smart bet; the number of followers that got removed, and added over night should've shown a red flag in that the value of Twitter is being INFLATED if this is true, Elon could get the company for even cheaper, etc.
@Newsweek @elonmusk So Elon musk will be voting for Greg Abbott?

Elon Musk is still going with his public nonsense  to get out of his Twitter deal. Imagine the bs he pulls in private. Zero integrity. If you’re a Tesla shareholder you’re going to lose it all. He’s a massive unhinged fraud with a brand that makes people think he’s a genius

@marizan_rafael @OdannyPaula La propuesta de Elon Musk de comprar Twitter también ha sido un escándalo mundial, pero no es ilegal. Así que 🤷🏻‍♂️

@richsignorelli @elonmusk @Twitter @Tesla It has been an epic misjudgment to pursue Twit - Elon apparently is unaware of the concept of hubris

@EricSims3525 No me, Pedro the Dog. I would just as soon he keep his nose out of twitter...I mean has almost nothing interesting or relevant to say. But either way I'll stick around if only to be continuously amazed at how unpredictable humans can be.
This is as creepy as it gets! https://t.co/7W9xdzAsyo

@sharkbiotech Elon fans think that he is above all regulations and contracts. They lack critical ability to THINK.

@Newsweek @elonmusk YES!!! But, if they cheat again...will not matter)))
@clunatoon @itdbitd @peterwsinger For real. America needs to understand, this isn’t the Republican Party becoming more extremist (The Brooks Brothers riot was just as Antidemocratic as 1/6) but rather the mask is now just completely slipping off. And yeah, I agree that Elon Musk sucks gigantic  buttnuggets.
Actually Soros and Jews fund them.  The only reason you peopke are suddenly so explicitly anti-Elon for being a billionaire is that he's a Gentile and believes in free speech. https://t.co/cfzVgg9m07
