@erickmiles smh chile they want trump back badly and elon basically said he is backing out of the deal
@kazooshiz @Timcast You under the impression that the american left has only ever been compromised of marxists? While marxists have existed here for a long while this is a new development of radicalization within the left since social media. The left radicalized and pulling the right into moderates.
@pikachu_coin_io @leo @Ang https://t.co/fYMVNsF08n
I think Elon Musk drinks leftist tears, all of these people are freaking out about how he is "backing out" of his purchase because he is wanting sufficient evidence that there are bots on the Twitter platform as a whole. Also, a lot of people are upset about the bot experiment.
Elon Musk is starting to sound like Donald Trump part 2.

Elon Musk a detenido la compra de Twitter hasta que no tenga el n√∫mero exacto de bots en la red, los propietarios, socios actuales afirman que solo es un 5% de los suscriptores actuales.

@enscand @ElectrekCo @FredericLambert JFC, this product isn't slowed down. Period. NOBODY has come closer to delivering on a fully autonomous automobile. Especially not the haters still clinging on to LIDAR years after Elon warned them that vision is all that was needed.
@EricSims3525 I feared Elon was going to do this, especially after what he did when he pumped and dumped Bitcoin. I think his goal was to expose Twitter. Well, he accomplished that goal, if nothing else.
@EricSims3525 Yes I'll vacate the premises asap just like I did Facebook.
@markadams500 @katstillhere Elon won‚Äôt pay for a social media platform whose CEO won‚Äôt disclose the number of bots that are on this app. The man doesn‚Äôt want to be overcharged for his purchase.  This tweet isn‚Äôt the flex that you think it is bud.

@GerberKawasaki Ross, your first sentence is accurate, but not quite right with the $14 billion. His damages are capped at a reverse termination fee of $1 billion. So TWTR has the option of suing him for $1 bn or compelling him to close (specific performance). Neither r great options for TWTR.

@WholeMarsBlog @garyblack00 @squawksquare Elon understood that he can't combine Tesla with his other companies into X holding because Tesla shareholder base is different.  Tesla investors might not want btc and twtr side hussle or if Elon chooses it, more clear direction of his intent and assurance it won't impact Tsla.
@cb_doge @elonmusk If bots are 4 times (perhaps more) then that means the bots are 15% more than advertised by SEC filings.  I'd reduce the offer by 15/95 (about16%) and a 4% penalty.  So, 20% discount for lying to the SEC.
@mattyglesias @MarcGoldwein He stinks

@TheRealHoarse @elonmusk Tesla was founded in July '03 by Martin Eberhard &amp; Marc Tarpenning. In February '04, via a $6.5 million investment, Elon Musk became the largest shareholder of the company. He's just a rich barnacle asshole regarding Tesla.

@ericowensdc You can waive due diligence to expedite a deal, and as part of a purchase agreement. But Musk would certainly have a claim if it turns out Twitter intentionally lied about its key user metric. The whole point of Musk bringing this up is to entice twitter to accept lower deal

@hodgetwins It's a common pattern, someone finds an issue that they care about, look into it, realize there is something fishy going on. Talks about it, then gets demonized by the left. Pushing them to go side with the right who also think something fishy is going on.

I have no idea how many users - human or bot - Twitter has or what Elon Musk thinks/been advised.  Picking 100 random followers of a certain user is not the right sampling method. It's biased, it's called stratified sampling and it has limitations in generalization

@elonmusk @Teslarati You are admired as a guy who work hard, think outside the box and get things done, not as the "dog ate my homework" kinda guy. Twitter will triple value once you're done with it, just purchases it as is. Whining about spam bots now doesn't help your reputation.
@QTRBlackGarrett @elonmusk @bennyjohnson I am kinda leaning towards Elon realizing twitter isn't a platform at all because 50%-90% of subscribers are bots or duplicate accounts Instead it is simply a money laundering operation to allow corporations to funnel money in the guise of advertisements, which is tax deductible
@Jules31415 Fed spending only causes inflation when it‚Äôs given largely to monopolists &amp; plutocrats who use it to complicate &amp; distort our economy &amp; for unproductive things like stock buy-backs-not if given to small biz (&amp; their customers) for local production &amp; distribution so supply =demand

Leftist politicians already created that war when they cultivated anger &amp; hatred among their followers, toward non-Leftists 2008-2012 &amp; increased it when Hillary lost @ 2016-today.

@dkealey @sarafischer @elonmusk He waived due diligence. He knows His supporters don't care about that so he'll pretend he was victimized.
@NotWoofers I don't think so.  The market is telling us that it doesn't think so.  Musk did no due diligence so can't come back at TWTR on subs.  Caveat emptor.  TWTR will sue Musk for breach of agreement and try to force him to pay the now ridiculous $54.20 but will walk away with a deal.

@bennyjohnson It's actually a very ignorant statement that Elon made. If you know anything about a teleprompter...a speech has to be written by a speech writer, approved by the president, and then uploaded to a teleprompter to be read. A teleprompter is NOT a machine that writes speeches.

@Newsweek @elonmusk Who freaking cares? He's a rich, entitled white supremacist who doesn't give a shit about anything but his money.
@FantasyDocDude It's actually a very ignorant statement that Elon made. If you know anything about a teleprompter...a speech has to be written by a speech writer, approved by the president, and then uploaded to a teleprompter to be read. A teleprompter is NOT a machine that writes speeches.
@ElectrekCo @SCOOTERDOLL Elon Musk is a beta male cuck that is afraid to talk about the mass murder that happened within 5 miles of Gigafactory 2 in Buffalo, NY. He doesn't want to talk about how he would moderate the murders videos and if he'd allow them on Twitter.
@dalienx @Yanky_Pollak @elonmusk @bennyjohnson And Twitter will also go down in a flaming heap of dung if that happens. üòÇ
@Albert1049 @POTUS This is one I disagree with under our current of circumstances. I think, however, Elon is saying this in the future he envisions, where we use use resources MUCH more efficiently and have sustainable energy.
@ManMadeMoon Mate‚Ä¶
@shitcoinisseur That's their fault for buying a stock above the pending buy out price at a P/E ratio of 180. It was a greedy thing to do on their part.  Elon shouldn't be locked into a deal made on fraudulent terms for the sake of other people.

@realChasDarwin @elonmusk Still deflecting. The point, mr. Intellectually dishonest is that, in speaking to your original comment‚Äù is that blocking someone for whatever reason doesn‚Äôt infringe on the other persons right to say what they want. The two are not mutually exclusive
Can't help but wonder whether Elon has created bots to get out of the deal. I've never seen so many bots on here.
I love that Elon Musk is so savvy that he can get the SEC to maybe do what they and the media should have done years ago and investigate to massive amounts of bots and shills employed by Liberals on Twitter.

@bennyjohnson @elonmusk Is he confusing left and communism or is he really that dumb? Of course he is worried about his ‚Äújob‚Äù. He works four hours a week. No oversight. Changes if Elon comes in. Actually got to earn your money.
@iamraisini @elonmusk @EvaFoxU @SECGov From 9% he can go up to 15% so, dropping down the share price is basically is in his favor! Otherwise, why would he discuss this subject publicly? Think also about the others who would buy now and are part of the new private company!

@ElectrekCo @MicahToll Elon Musk is a beta male cuck that is afraid to talk about the mass murder that happened within 5 miles of Gigafactory 2 in Buffalo, NY. He doesn't want to talk about how he would moderate the murders videos and if he'd allow them on Twitter.
@elonmusk @EvaFoxU @SECGov @elonmusk you already know no one is home at the SEC.  You built an entire empire by sucking up investment capital making outlandish claims. Your Tesla build rate estimates have been off by literally an order of magnitude at times.  Twitter is just running the Elon Musk playbook.
@FoxNews Go get 'em Elon!!!! It's time to clean house!!!!!
Basically, he clicked "I've read terms &amp; conditions" without having read the terms and conditions like every single other person on Twitter. https://t.co/p8DR3rHIng

@elonmusk @bennyjohnson And Elon, you are a smart guy. I'm sure you know of forensic tools that can confirm authenticity. Ok, gotcha, rhetorical question.
Kicking out every moderate person person as a "Far Right Extremist" in itself seems like a trolling ploy it's like an experiment of "How far can we Troll until they reject us" I can't tell who's the victim or perpetrator anymore just All of USA https://t.co/cxVB6BQl6J

@squawksquare just wait 6 hours and this dude will find a reason to flip insanely bullish again. Maybe cause Elon has a nice and natural bowel movement or something.
@Esqueer_ At least you don't get a single character emoji.  Bearing in mind where the share price goes without Elons bid it's likely a compromise needs to be achieved. I think Elon has a case that real users vs fake users is higher than declared in SEC docs and possibly and board agree.

@theMRC @elonmusk Fed spending only causes inflation when it‚Äôs given largely to monopolists &amp; plutocrats who use it to complicate &amp; distort our economy &amp; for unproductive things like stock buy-backs-not if given to small biz (&amp; their customers) for local production &amp; distribution so supply =demand
@EricSims3525 Yes
@EricSims3525 I left Twitter and Facebook both over 2 years ago due to the censorship. I recently returned after the news of Elon making the deal and killing off the censorship. However I wouldn't have be a problem leaving again if the deal went sour. Free speech or no speech thanks!
@edcu @racecar_babytoy @johnfguild @mattyglesias What if Twitter lied?  That matters not?  You‚Äôre hanging way to much on this deal. The deal didn‚Äôt create inflation and supply chain disruption.

@therecount It's actually a very ignorant statement that Elon made. If you know anything about a teleprompter...a speech has to be written by a speech writer, approved by the president, and then uploaded to a teleprompter to be read. A teleprompter is NOT a machine that writes speeches.

Elon Musk said his $44 billion deal for Twitter can‚Äôt move forward until the company is clearer about how many of its accounts are fake https://t.co/PUbhwbME2o
@stephen_taylor It's quite possible that the market performance of Elon's cash cow, TSLA, is influencing his opinion on TWTR.  Tesla stock is still a very pricey stock but it is down 40% from its high and that is many billions to Elon.
@elon_set When you put it like that, you sound even more as if you're feeling oppressed.  You have put yourself on your own list.
@blangb Yes, Elon has endeared himself to the SEC, and they are jumping when he says jump.

@FoxNews It's actually a very ignorant statement that Elon made. If you know anything about a teleprompter...a speech has to be written by a speech writer, approved by the president, and then uploaded to a teleprompter to be read. A teleprompter is NOT a machine that writes speeches.

This is a good thread, and highlights one of the main reasons I sorta suspect Elon may have feigned interest in purchasing Twitter as a monetizable strategy as opposed to a serious purchase attempt. e.g. Is Musk shorting Twitter stock after he rocketed the price? https://t.co/s648gOzuIh
@PmurtTrump You know how trump would tease the public regarding anything controversial he said he'd do, musk is rather like trump in that respect. He also dances around, teases by throwing his hat off then like a stripper takes his jacket off throwing it to the side. His young fans go wild.
@postalbuck23 That's why they're going üêµüí© over Elon Musk taking over he's not going to put up with that nonsense.
@AmandaLarreni Musk actually calls the American people who elected Biden fool
@ccowboy723 Perhaps Biden does not know that he is treating America like fools, perhaps he does not know any better.  Perhaps expecting him to treat America with respect and to protect it, is expecting too much from him.

@mominbayarea Hey Mom. Isn't it awesome how the woman are running this court room? JD/AH
TBH, it could be both. Maybe his strategy was, buy Twitter, but create turmoil during the process, at which time he cashes out short positions, which help his finances for after the purchase completes.  THIS is what the SEC should be looking at, though.
@Timcast I don't think this is representative of anything. Musk is extremely wealthy. Most of that wealth is tied up in stocks and unrealized gains. Liberals have discussed taxing unrealized gains on the super-wealthy. That would hurt Musk.

Free money for 2 years. Ppl were paid more money to sit home than they made at work. Companies had to pay more to bring them back. Companies need to charge more to keep profits up. Boom. Inflation. https://t.co/4umTFqtX1E
Well I think the ads revenue tells the story about how many really users are on there. And Elon's not stupid. Ad revenue is what money a site makes .if it's mostly bots there is no money so Twitter is lying about there real people. So lower the price or he walks. Simple. https://t.co/5k1dA0B6mP
@Newsweek @elonmusk Who cares ???????? Really, who f#cking cares ?????
Twitter is one of the most overvalued companies, the moment it pumped from that Elon Musk news, I opened massive short positions.   Even Elon Musk knows there is no hope for saving Twitter, I predict he will dump his shares in the near future.
For everyone speculating on Elon &amp; Twitter, it's going to come down to the deal language. I have no idea what they are but anyone who has ever done an acquisition, especially this size knows there are inches of paper work. Absent knowing what that language says, just guesses

@ClayHale7 @GreenHombre @Amy_Siskind I agree. But he is questioning what they report as ratio of bots to real accts. He thinks its higher and they are "misreporting".  It's ridiculous for sure. But then we are talking about Elon.

@mthilt03 @RobPMKE @Garrett_Love @elonmusk Mike, no he actually sold.  (Even twitted he dont plan to sell any more from that point forward). Maybe he will use some shares for loan, but again, he sold.  https://t.co/y8ZBQFX9Qc

@skyline991gt3 @Gee5301 @garyblack00 @elonmusk Twitter has good lawyers probably some of the best (after dealing with trump nonsense).

@squawksquare Maybe he should stop acting altogether &amp; focus on being the CEO of a $70B company. Maybe someday Tesla (the company, not the stock) will actually be a $700B company rather than just a stock. Careful observers will see the obvious stumbling block with him doing any such thing.
@WUTangKids Poor Elon, pinning his hopes on Project Veritas and not understanding the rule: if that claim truth in their name, it's not.
@bennyjohnson @elonmusk Anyone with a functioning brain and who is not already "Red" has already realized that @Twitter is as "Commie as F**k".  So good for Veritas - another confirmation. But why the outrage when Elon makes the buy from MSM and the Biden Regime? Maybe they're also as Commie as F**k.

@DemocraticDaisy @GOPChairwoman I am middle class and I enjoyed the tax cuts and my 401K. The month of April through mid may I‚Äôve lost 92.000 in my 401K. The rich pay taxes, 2021 Elon paid over 11 billion in taxes. That does not include his employees, healthcare, state and local taxes.

@elonmusk It's financial ploy to benefit Twitter's current ownership in revenue probably a lot more fake than even Elon says
If Twitter is really a town square for ideas like Elon musk says then it should be owned by the government not a businessman
Elon Musk is the real mccoy, imagine making a $44 billion acquisition of a social network. And somehow you change your mind about the acquisition and you have to pay $1 billion termination fee.
@TheElk801 @unclekartwheel @Twitter @elonmusk So what if he's born rich? He's doing more good for the world than Paris Hilton, Kim Kardashian or Hunter Biden.

@MaxAbrahms No. US gov gave 10.7 million to Twitter for user accounts. Propaganda to keep him from buying and make him feel he would lose stock and favor by buying. Also, whenever America has an election dormant bots get activated. It's midterms. During a Presidential election it's worse.
@EricSims3525 No
Hey, Elon.  Is it just me or do this fucks like wasting time?

@ideafaktory @matt_levine Elon belongs in prison
@sashayanshin Ultimately, Elon will own Twitter. The deal will be re-priced and life moves on. The court in Delaware will force this deal to happen.   Twitter will be upgraded as will Tesla, SpaceX, etc. There may be short term pain but Twitter will be worth much more under Elon's direction.

@EricSims3525 Well now that it's revealed to be half bogus crap we can just stay here and enjoy ourselves the same.   We've always known TWIT only censors conservatives.   So unless  people tell me another social media is as fun as it is here?   I'll stay.

@clunatoon @itdbitd @peterwsinger For real.
